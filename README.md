The idea of this project is to always be up to date with the recents hot submissions from different subreddits. 
A collection of AWS service serves to gather all submissions into a dynamodb table and notify whenever a new submission have been identified.
Some rules can be applied to better tailor the identification of said submissions, such as the number of comments.
